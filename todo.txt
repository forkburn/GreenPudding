dragging: current solution
    on touch: find the closes dot, give it a force, proportional to
dragging:
    on touch: get drag start point. treat any dots within a radius as dragged. record their distance from drag point. set dragForceScaler = 1-disToTouchPoint/radius
    on each frame dragging: record drag vector. each dragged dot gets a force= globalDragforceScaler * dragForceScaler * dragVector
    on release: stop dragging state
