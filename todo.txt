dragging: current solution
    on touch: find the closes dot, give it a force, proportional to how far it's from mouse
dragging:
    on touch:
        get drag start point.
        treat any dots within a radius as dragged. record their displacement  vec from mouse and store in a list.
            nodePosRelativeToTouchPoint = nodePos - mousePos

    on each frame dragging:
        for each dragged point, nodeBalancePos = currentMousePos + nodePosRelativeToTouchPoint
        for each dragged point, use its currentPos and balancePos to calc accelr
    on release: stop dragging state
